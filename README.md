# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to write a code in html for a recipe website. At the end of this assignment, I will have used and learn how to efficiently
use commands, write a basic code for a website in html and progress in my own studies in this subject. I am also hopeful to better understand how git and github work in sense of saving my code into a repository.
