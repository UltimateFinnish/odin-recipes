        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <p><img src="lasagna.jpg" class="image1"</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Lean ground beef</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Garlic salt</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        </ol>
